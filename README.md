## EKS Cluster with Terraform

This Terraform configuration provisions a production-ready Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster on AWS.

### Prerequisites

* AWS account with necessary permissions.
* Terraform installed and configured.
* AWS CLI installed and configured.

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Navigate to the directory:** `cd eks-cluster-terraform`
3. **Configure Terraform variables:**
   * Update the variables in `variables.tf` with your desired values.
4. **Initialize Terraform:** `terraform init`
5. **Apply the configuration:** `terraform apply`

### Customization

The configuration can be customized for different environments (development, staging, production) using the `environment` variable. You can create separate variable files for each environment and use the `-var-file` flag when applying Terraform.

### Example:

```bash
# Apply the configuration for the development environment
terraform apply -var-file=variables-dev.tf

# Apply the configuration for the staging environment
terraform apply -var-file=variables-staging.tf
```

### Best Practices

This configuration adheres to AWS's well-architected framework and infrastructure best practices, including:

* Separate subnets for EKS cluster and other resources.
* Proper IP address management.
* NAT Gateway for outbound internet access.
* Security groups and network ACLs to control traffic.
* Regional cluster for high availability.
* Private endpoint access.
* Node auto-scaling and cluster autoscaling.
* IAM roles for service accounts.
* EKS Managed Node Groups with encryption at rest.
* AWS PrivateLink for secure communication.
* AWS Secrets Manager for encryption of secrets.
* Kubernetes network policies.
* Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting.
* Amazon CloudTrail for API activity logging.
* Least privilege access using IAM roles and policies.
* Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for cost optimization.
* Maintenance windows and update channels for node groups.
* Auto-repair and auto-upgrade for nodes.
* Amazon RDS for database needs.
* Amazon S3 buckets for persistent storage.
* Amazon CloudFront for content delivery.
